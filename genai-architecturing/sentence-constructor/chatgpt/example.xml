    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Ver-past]?

    Considerations:

    - The first part is stating a location where something  exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    - Attempt an answer
    - Ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - Ask clues about question formation
    - Ask clues about verb conjugation
